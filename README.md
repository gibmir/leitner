This project represents the Leitner system implementation.
The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by
the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. It is a simple implementation of 
the principle of spaced repetition, where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.
